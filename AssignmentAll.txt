AI Engineer – Computer Vision, NLP & GenAI 
(Full-Time Hiring Assignment) 
 
 
 Important Notes: 
1. Please read the “Assignment Submission” section at the end of this 
document before starting the assignment. 
2. The assignment may take approximately 3–4 hours to complete. We 
understand that many candidates may not finish it entirely — consider 
this a fun and challenging opportunity! 
3. You are encouraged to use any LLM (Large Language Model) for 
assistance, including generating code to speed up development. 
4. We welcome and appreciate the use of AI tools in this assignment. 
Watch the video “Task 1 - Explanation.mp4”, “Task 2 - Explanation.mp4” & 
“Task 3 - Explanation.mp4” available in the shared Drive folder for a 
walkthrough of the tasks. 
Task 1 – RGB-Thermal Image Overlay Algorithm (15 Points) 
Objective: Align thermal images with their corresponding RGB counterparts 
and generate overlaid outputs. 
Requirements: 
1. Develop a Python script that processes all image pairs within an 
input folder. 
2. Each image pair follows the format: 
○ XXXX_T.JPG – Thermal image 
○ XXXX_Z.JPG – RGB image 
3. XXXX denotes the shared identifier for each image pair. 
4. The script should read one pair at a time and overlay the thermal 
image onto the RGB image. 
5. Note: As the images are captured from two different cameras, they 
are not perfectly aligned by default. 
6. The output should be an adjusted thermal image aligned with the 
RGB image (RGB remains unchanged). 
7. Refer to the submission folder structure at the end of this document. 
8. Sample outputs can be found in the "sample-output" folder. 
Task 2 – Change Detection Algorithm (10 Points) 
Objective: Detect and highlight differences between “before” and “after” 
images of the same scene. 
Requirements: 
1. Write a Python script that takes an input folder containing paired 
before-and-after images. 
2. The images are guaranteed to be 100% aligned. 
3. Naming convention: 
○ Before: X.jpg 
○ After: X~2.jpg 
4. Your script should: 
○ Load each pair 
○ Compare the images 
○ Highlight changes by drawing a polygon, segment, or bounding 
box around missing objects in the after image. 
5. Refer to the submission folder structure below for output formatting.
Task 3 – GLR Pipeline with Streamlit (25 Points) 
Objective: Automate insurance template filling using photo reports and 
LLMs via a simple Streamlit interface. 
Requirements: 
1. Build a Streamlit app that accepts: 
○ An insurance template in .docx format 
○ Multiple photo reports in .pdf format 
2. The script should: 
○ Extract text from the photo reports 
○ Use an LLM to interpret the template fields and detect 
key-value pairs 
○ Populate the template with extracted data from the reports 
3. The final output should be a filled-in .docx document based on the 
photo reports. 
4. Use the OpenRouter LLM APIs (Or any LLM you are comfortable 
with) listed here: 
Free LLM APIs including DeepSeek 
5. Ensure the Streamlit app: 
○ Accepts the above inputs 
○ Displays and allows download of the generated output 
 
 
 Assignment Submission Structure 
Create a Google Drive folder and ensure the following structure is followed: 
➤ Task 1: 
● task_1_code.py – Python code 
● task_1_output/ – Contains: 
○ Input RGB images: XXXX_Z.JPG 
○ Output adjusted thermal images: XXXX_AT.JPG 
● Do not include the input thermal images (XXXX_T.JPG) 
➤ Task 2: 
● task_2_code.py – Python code 
● task_2_output/ – Contains: 
○ Input before images: X.jpg 
○ Output annotated after images: X~3.jpg 
● Do not include the original after images (X~2.jpg) 
➤ Task 3: 
● code files 
● task_3_output/ – Contains outputs for the 3 photo reports 
● task_3.mp4 – Screen recording of the Streamlit app demo (You can 
use OBS or Loom), showing: 
○ End-to-end working with one photo report and the template 
○ Input selection and output generation 
○ No voice-over is required 
❌
 Submission Guidelines 
● DO NOT zip the files or folders. Zipped submissions will be 
disqualified. 
● Set the Google Drive folder sharing to “Anyone with the link can 
view.” 
○ Submissions without proper permissions will not be accepted. 
Good luck! We’re excited to see your creativity and technical skills in 
action.
